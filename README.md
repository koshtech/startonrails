Badge Page
----------

For those people that participate regularly, the monitors will give them awesome badges that will be shown in this
page. Initialy, there will be six differents badges for starters and monitors. Starters that participated 4 
or more startonrails' events will receive the first badge named Scaffold Man. For those that participated more than
8 times will receive the Alpha Tester badge and if you mastered all the concepts exposed in the staronrails event 
and participated more than 10 times you'll receive the honorous Rails Master title and will be invited to be a 
monitor in the next events. The Rails Mentor badge will be given to monitors that participated once. Finally, if 
you participated monitoring the starters for more than 10 events, you'll receive the Rails Prophet badge.

Just one more thing, there'll be extra badges according to the project done. The first one will be the StartOnRails
Website Developer for who participated of the startonrails website development.
